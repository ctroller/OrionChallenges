#OrionChallenges
Displays a window with the nearest challenges in your current zone, and allows you to one-click Start, Cancel or Loot finished challenges. It also allows you to automatically start challenges and display the loot window when finishing a challenge. Also filterable by type (General, Item, Ability, Combat Challenge).
Another feature is that OrionChallenges displays Challenge Start Locations on your Zone Map (as for now only Carbine's Default Zone Map is supported).

You can always grab the latest code from Github, but be aware that the version on there might contain bugs!

Also, if you have any ideas on how to improve the addon let me know by posting a comment or reaching out to me ingame!
